# Treasure-Cave
Treasure Cave is a text-based maze style adventure game, played out a 2D model board (or virtual map), taking  place in a dark mysterious cave of an unknown location. Rumors spread of a treasure beyond your wildest dream  guarded by a gruesome monster, while seekers go searching and never return. The cave is rumored to hold  weapons of other adventures who never returned; a sword, a torch, a noise maker and a magical eye; as well as  a monster, a treasure and an elusive enemy. You navigate the model board using the aswd keys to go west, south,  north, and east, and use q to quit the game. To win, you must find the treasure and exit the cave. If the  monster kills you, you lose.
